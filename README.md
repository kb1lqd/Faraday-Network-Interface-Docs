# Faraday-Network-Interface-Docs

The focus of the FaradayRF open source digital radio is to create an open source development platform that provides access, education, and functionality. This platform is more than a development tool, it is an amateur radio ecosystem where people can learn, play, and innovate. Our focus is not to make the best and most sensitive digital amateur radio but to create a community where we explore the unique benefits and use-cases that amateur radio has to offer over other mediums. Simply replacing the internet using amateur radio is not appropriate or acceptable. In the digital world amateur radio is not longer held to primarily real time "contacts" but instead routing algorithms and applications that open the hobby to new adventures.

## Focus
Simplicity and use of standards should be preferred over more novel solutions. In this development effort please consider:

* Minimizing use of firmware
  * Utilize the processing power and ease of development on larger computer systems (i.e. Rasberry Pi)
* Use standard interfaces and protocols where possible
* Reduce the barrier to entry as much as possible
  * Development
  * Users
* Create smaller project deliverables intelligently organized into their own repositories
* Create tools that are open to the amateur radio community (not just Faraday hardware) where feasible (i.e. APRStoinfluxdb)

## Use Case Examples

The primary initial goal of this Faraday digital interface and network is to create an intuitive and working digital platform that:

* Provide education by example and community
* Explore application and network layer use cases unique to amateur radio
  * Store-and-forward networks
  * Delay tolerant networks
  * Community network applications and tools


  Within the network development we may find ourselves exploring delay tolerant and store-and-forward networks that provide extensive digital coverage even when radios are temporarily out of range.

  Amatuer radio uses will also be explored using this technology. "Contesting" as currently known is ripe for innovation where a digital network can track, authenticate, and reward using the data it is collecting.
