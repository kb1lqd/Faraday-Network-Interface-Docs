# Meeting Notes 11-14-2017

## Agenda

* Discuss TUN implementation issues
* Discuss development plan and deliverables


**Attendees**
* Brent (KB1LQD)
* Mike (KB3YQH)

## Notes
* Agreed that current path is too:
  * Create simple TUN network adapter to output packets
  * Create python program to link TUN network adapter to Faraday over UART
  * Use current datalink (Layer 2) in Faraday as the Layer 2
    * Should modify in future for infinite packet length but use packet hardware for now and deal with fragmentation
* Deliverable Tests
  * NETCAT data over two Faraday units
    * UDP, TCP
* Development Structure
  * Break needed programs into discrete repositories
    * High level "module" program repository
      * A program that glues sub-modules together and is main program executed
    * TUN Adapter repository
    * TUN-to-Faraday UART adapter repository


## Useful discussion references/points

* MTU of IPV4 is 68 bytes
* RFC791 IP protocol spec.
* Best to use current packet hrdware as it works right now and move on.
* Decide on fixed MTU and linux kernel can handle fragmentation in Tun adapter. Maybe can't go below 68?
* TCP MSS (maximum segment size)  needed as well, optimzed for TCP trafic for things like FTP at CAT images, files, etcâ€¦
* Is TCP OK for long term for wireless? Windows and scaling.
* Is layer 2 easier to write in python?
* Writing a network driver may be long term goal but TUN gets us started now.
